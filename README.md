The "masterpiece" of my highschool years, Eastside Minesweeper is an exact clone of the edition of minesweeper that came with Windows XP. I wrote this program in Visual Basic using Visual Studio 2005 as a Junior in highschool in 2009. At the time, Visual Basic was all I knew and while the course I was taking taught simple games like "tic-tac-toe" and "hangman", I had my sights set somewhat higher. I also happened to be a perfectionist with an obsession for cloning at the time and other than the color scheme and images, modeled my version of minesweeper exactly after the Windows XP version. It features all of the same difficulty levels, plus an extra one I call suicide (try it out!). It even features highscores and uses the registry for persistant storage. Since my highschool years I have made no modifications to the program although I have since used Visual Studio 2012 to view the project and hence it converted and updated several of the file types and structure. There is a serious lack of comments and probably several places the program could be optimized. However, this program was written within a couple months of the first time I had been exposed to any programming language (other than TI-BASIC) so I consider it a great accomplishment.
